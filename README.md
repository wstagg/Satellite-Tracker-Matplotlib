Requires OrbitFetcher with python bindings.

Copy and the OrbitFetcher shared library into the src directory along with the config.txt (dont forget to have a valid API key).

This is a simple satellite tracker. It calls the N2YOs "whats above" API to get up to 80 satellites above the observer location (depending on search radius) allong with the ISS.
